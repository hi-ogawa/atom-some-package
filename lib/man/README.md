man (with helm autocompletion and with normal buffer search) is one of the reasons I still heavily need Emacs.

This package tries to port similar functionality to Atom.


# TODO

- Atom API compativility
- Better way (less hacky way) to use find-and-replace functionality
- Insert (or replace) shell command output inline as in Emacs's `shell-command-on-region`'s `C-u M-|`.
- Testing
- Attach screenshot
